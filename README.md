## About
This project was developed by Nils-Christopher Wiesenauer ([NurNils](https://github.com/NurNils)), Namid Marxen ([NurNils](https://github.com/NamidM)), Philipp FÃ¶rster ([PhilippFoerster](https://github.com/PhilippFoerster)), Daniel Zichler ([Clawset](https://github.com/Clawset)) and Elian Yildirim ([elian15122000](https://github.com/elian15122000)) during the 2nd semester as part of the project management II lecture at DHBW Stuttgart. The main purpose of this web application is to create a quiz game to learn new knowledge and terms in the field of project management.

ðŸ’š The system is based on the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js)-Stack with the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality in the backend.

ðŸ’¬ Socket.IO is used to create a low-latency communication between all platforms for a live multiplayer gameplay. [More info](https://socket.io/)
